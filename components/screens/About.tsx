          I&apos;m a full-stack developer with experience building large-scale
          applications, freelancing, and crafting projects that blend
          functionality with great user experiences.

          I admire developers who can bridge the gap between backend logic and
          frontend aesthetics. While roles are often divided, I aim to be
          someone who not only writes efficient code but also designs intuitive
          interfaces.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-[2] mt-16 text-text">
          I enjoy creating interactive and dynamic experiencesâ€”whether it&apos;s
          a well-designed UI, smooth animations, or systems that respond
          seamlessly to user actions. To me, the best applications feel like a
          conversation between the user and the technology.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-[2] mt-16 text-text">
          In my free time I enjoy doing a variety of other things like creating
          and animating things in blender. For eg, the room on the left (or top
          for mobile users) is a one-on-one accurate representation of my real
          room.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-[2] mt-16 text-text">
          I also love playing video games a lot and watching/consuming a lot of
          japanese content (animes, mangas, visual novels, etc) and I am
          actively learning japanese to maybe one day work in Japan. To that end
          I am also active on discord and helping groups on discord translate
          various japanese media to english.
